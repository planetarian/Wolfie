# Wolfie
Wolfenstein 3D rendering engine clone

This is an old project of mine that sought to imitate the old-school pseudo-3D
rendering engines used by games like Wolfenstein 3D, DOOM, and Duke Nukem 3D.

This was written in C# using the XNA (now MonoGame) framework.
As such, getting it going in the latest versions of Visual Studio may be difficult.

Levels are defined purely as text files.

It was written on a weekend several years ago, while deep in codemonkey mode.

I had to re-learn trigonometry to pull it off. Kids, pay attention in math class =)

This is purely a rendering engine experiment.
There is no collision, enemies, health, weapons, ammo, keys, or point.
